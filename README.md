# RemoteDiff

A native macOS app for viewing git diffs from remote servers over SSH, with side-by-side file comparison and live change watching.

## Features

- **Three view modes** — Side-by-side full file, diff hunks, or single-pane full file
- **SSH git diff** — Fetches diffs from remote hosts via `/usr/bin/ssh`, shell-agnostic (bash, fish, zsh)
- **Live watching** — ControlMaster-based persistent SSH with 2s polling and 800ms debounce
- **Connection management** — Save SSH connections with multiple repositories, auto-fetch on selection
- **Untracked & staged files** — Option to include untracked and staged files in the diff
- **Remote branch display** — Shows the current branch on the remote, auto-refreshes
- **30+ language configs** — File-extension-based language detection for syntax-aware rendering
- **SSH config integration** — Auto-parses `~/.ssh/config` for host picker
- **Diff result caching** — Switch between repos without re-fetching
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — ⌘R refresh, ⌘[ ⌘] navigate files

## Building

```bash
swift build
swift test       # 37 tests
open RemoteDiff.xcodeproj
```

## Distributing

```bash
./scripts/build-app.sh
```

Creates `.build/release/RemoteDiff.app` and a `.zip` ready to share. On the target Mac, unzip and drag to `/Applications`. First launch: right-click → Open to bypass Gatekeeper (app is not notarized).

## Usage

1. Click **+** to create a connection and enter an SSH host
2. Add repositories with a path and git ref
3. Select a repo — auto-fetches the diff and displays in side-by-side mode
4. Use the segmented picker to switch between **Side by Side**, **Diff**, and **Full File** views
5. Toggle **Watch** for live change detection
